# CSC-Project
Cameron, Spencer &amp; Katie's final project

This project is designed to use a digital thermistor paired with our Raspberry Pi to make a functioning gui that displays temperature. 
This will then run through a function to determine if it is hot enough based on user input and turn on a heater if it is lacking in that.
This is a practical design that can be included in many home systems for certain areas.
